Graphs using Meteostat's data on San Diego for the year 2022.

In san_diego_lows_averages_highs.py, I plotted a line chart showing daily minimum, average, and maximum temperature.

In san_diego_lows.py, san_diego_averages.py, and san_diego_highs.py, I plotted a line chart showing daily minimum, average, and maximum temperature respectively and a trendline.

In san_diego_precipitation.py, I plotted the daily precipitation. I did not plot a trend line, since a majority of the points were at 0.

In san_diego_pressure.py, I plotted the daily pressure and a trendline.

In san_diego_pressure_vs_temperature.py, I plotted the pressure on the x axis versus the temperature on the y axis. I plotted the regression line and calculated the correlation coefficent and p-value.
